## Explanation

1. **Graph Representation:** the graph is represented as an object where each key is a node (e.g., `'A'`) and its value is an array of neighbor nodes (e.g., `['B', 'C']`).
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - A recursive helper function `dfsRecursive` is used to traverse the graph.
   - A `Set` named `visited` keeps track of nodes that have been visited to avoid cycles.
   - Each time a node is visited, it is added to the `result` array.
   - The function recursively visits each unvisited neighbor.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - A queue (implemented as an array) is used to traverse the graph level by level.
   - Nodes are dequeued, and if they havenâ€™t been visited, they are processed (added to `visited` and `result`).
   - All unvisited neighbors of the current node are enqueued for later processing.

## Complexity

- **Time:** O(V+E)
- **Memory:** O(V)
